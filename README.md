## ✨ Key Features & Hardware Specs
* **Microcontroller:** Microchip ATmega328P-AU (TQFP-32 SMD package).
* **Clock Speed:** 16MHz crystal oscillator for precise timing operations.
* **Power Management:** On-board 5V linear voltage regulator supporting dual power inputs (USB & VIN).
* **I/O Connectivity:** Standard 2.54mm pitch headers for all GPIOs, UART, and a dedicated ICSP header for bootloader flashing.
* **PCB Specs:** 2-Layer compact design with optimized VCC/GND routing and decoupling capacitors for signal integrity.

## 📂 Repository Structure
To keep the project organized and professional, the files are structured as follows:

* 📁 **`Hardware/`**: Contains the native Altium Designer source files (`.PrjPcb`, `.SchDoc`, `.PcbDoc`).
* 📁 **`Fabrication_Files/`**: Contains the exported PDF schematics and the Bill of Materials (BOM).
* 📁 **`Images/`**: High-resolution 2D and 3D renders of the PCB for quick viewing.
* 📄 **`index.html`**: The source code for the interactive portfolio website.
